# Project
A framework for running startups entirely by AI agents. You declare your company as a YAML file — tenant, agents, gateways, and risk policy — and the framework materializes it: each role agent gets a supervised process, an A2A endpoint, and a risk policy. The human interacts only with the CEO agent and approves risk escalations through a minimal monitoring UI.

- GO language it's used to build the framework.
- YAML to define a new company.
- Markdown to define the skills of each agent inside of a company
- A2A protocol to build the communication between agents (Linux Foundation)
- We follow the SDD flow for every feature made, and storing the specs in openspec and engram (if available)

# How to build
go build ./cmd/company

# How to test
TDD is mandatory for this project, then you need to run the tests before pushing a PR
```
go test ./...
```

It's very important to run all the tests before pushing a PR. There is a CI that will block the PRs, so we should validate before pushing.
